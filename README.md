A notification system for tiling window managers. `twmn` is two things:

`twmnc`: command line tool to send notifications to `twmnd`. You can also use `notify-send` for a similar purpose, but `twmnc` is more powerful. See `twmnc --help` for more information.

`twmnd`: daemon listening to notification requests and showing them one after another. Configure it at `~/.config/twmn/twmn.conf`. The file is generated the first time `twmnd` is launched.

Notifications are shown in a one-line bar called the notification slide. They can be navigated through and activated with shortcuts.

See `twmn.conf` for more information.

Installation
------------

For [Arch Linux](http://www.archlinux.org/) users, `twmn-git` is [on the AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/twmn-git/).

Otherwise you can install `twmnd` and `twmnc` manually:

1. install `boost` and `qt` if they weren't before, including the `widgets` and `x11extras` qt libraries
2. `git clone https://github.com/sboli/twmn.git` to get `twmn`
3. `cd twmn/`
4. `qmake` to generate a Makefile
5. `make` to compile
6. `sudo make install` to install `twmnd` and `twmnc` in `/usr/local/bin`. Make sure this folder is in your `$PATH` environment variable. (`export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin`)
7. for `twmnd` to be always running, add it to your `.xinitrc`, `rc.conf` or else

The `storage_notifier` example requires `dbus-python` to be installed. The `mpd_notifier` example requires `python-mpd` to be installed and running.
